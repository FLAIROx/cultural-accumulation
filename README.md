# Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning

Code for replicating experiments run in [_Artificial Generational Intelligence: Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00392).

## Memory Sequence Experiments
To run these experiments, simply open the Jupyter notebook __memory_sequence.ipynb__ and step through the cells.

## TSP Experiments
To run these experiments, simply open the Jupyter notebook __tsp.ipynb__ and step through the cells.

## Goal Sequence Experiments
### In-Context Accumulation
1. To train an oracle, run __goal_seq/train_oracle_s5.py__.
2. To train a social learner, run __goal_seq/train_social_s5.py__.
3. To evaluate in-context accumulation, run __goal_seq/in_context_accumulation.py__.

### In-Weights Accumulation
For this experiment, run __goal_seq/in_weights_accumulation.py__.
