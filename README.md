# Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning

Code for replicating experiments run in [Artificial Generational Intelligence: Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00392).

## Memory Sequence Experiments
To run these experiments, simply open the Jupyter notebook 'memory_sequence.ipynb' and step through the cells.

## TSP Experiments
To run these experiments, simply open the Jupyter notebook 'tsp.ipynb' and step through the cells.

## Goal Sequence Experiments
### In-Context Accumulation
- To train an oracle, run 'goal_seq/train_single_s5.py'.
- To train a social learner, run 'goal_seq/train_social_s5.py'.
- To evaluate in-context accumulation, run 'goal_seq/in_context_accumulation.py'.

### In-Weights Accumulation
For this experiment, run 'goal_seq/in_weights_accumulation.py'.
